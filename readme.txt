= General Questions =

<strong>What does it do?</strong>

DreamSpeed CDN connects your WordPress site to the DreamSpeed CDN, automatically pushing your media up to the CDN making it faster for your visitors.

<strong>Do you work for DreamHost?</strong>

Yes, but this isn't an official DreamHost plugin at this time. It just works.

<strong>Do I have to host my website on DreamHost?</strong>

No, but using it anywhere else is unsupported. You have to use Dream<em>Speed</em>, which belongs to Dream<em>Host</em>. This plugin was built on and specifically for DreamHost servers, so I can give you no assurance it'll work on other hosts

<strong>Can I use this on a Windows Server?</strong>

This is unsupported. You can try, and let me know how it goes. I built this for DreamHost, so it has only been tested on Linux boxes.

<strong>Can I use this on Multisite?</strong>

Not at this time.

= Using the Plugin =

<strong>Do I have to manually push images?</strong>

Nope! New image uploads are copied first to your normal location, then sync'd up.

<strong>Can I force older images to be pushed?</strong>

Not Yet.

= Errors =

<strong>It's reporting page not found when I access the pages</strong>

Upgrade to version 3.2 and tell PHP it's drunk.
