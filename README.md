DreamSpeed CDN (RETIRED)
==========

This was the development repository for the DreamSpeed CDN plugin.

> We will discontinue the DreamSpeed CDN add-on service on November 30, 2017 to make way for future enhancements to DreamObjects. DreamSpeed CDN didn’t quite live up to our expectations, and we’ve made the difficult decision to wind it down.

* [WP Readme](readme.txt)
* [Changelog](changelog.txt)

As of November 2017, this plugin is no longer maintained nor supported. Fork as you will.
